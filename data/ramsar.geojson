It is the environment of the West African manatee, staging area for the migratory Lesser flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor), and the Rachel's Malimbe (Malimbicus rachelia) . Its ecosystem embodies a biological, ecological and economical significance. It is of biological importance as a spawning ground and nursery path for which fish stocks. On the other hand it is of ecological value through recharge and discharge of underground water and sediment trapping. The economical aspects of the estuary are preponderant for the neighboring population through the fishing and wood industry. The main threat facing this site is the alien invasive species Nypa fructicans which is dominating the indigenous mangrove species (Avicennia germinans, Conocarpus erectus, Rhizophora harrisonii, Rhizophora mangle et Rhizophora racemosa).

Parc National. One of the world's largest Ramsar sites, a complex of floodplains, hills, a lake, rivers and ponds located in a natural depression at the border with the Central Africa Republic. The site plays a very important role for the surrounding wildlife, providing breeding grounds for several migratory waterbirds and supporting hippos, leopards, elephants and different antelope species. It also is a spawning and nursery ground for several fish families, and plays a role in flood control, groundwater recharge, sediment trapping and chemical regulation of the waters. Fishing is an important socio-economic activity, with annual catches amounting to 15,000 tonnes; the area is also a renowned grazing ground, and different crops are grown according to the habitat type. Local trees are used for medicinal purposes, firewood and fruit. Tourism in the Zakouma National Park and hunting concessions can potentially be further exploited. The main threats to the site arise from poaching, oil exploration, over-grazing, illegal fires and contamination by pesticides.

It is potentially the last refuge for numerous endangered species, and it hosts five of the seven sea turtle species that visit West African waters, including the leatherback, olive ridley, hawksbill and green turtle. The bird species present include little stint, black-tailed godwit, sanderling, bar-tailed godwit, Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, red knot and great white egret. The Site is also a feeding area for humpback dolphins and African manatees. In the area surrounding the Kalissaye wetlands, fish smoking activities have implications for the Site&rsquo;s resources and their dynamics, while exploitation of the Site&rsquo;s rich habitats threatens the biodiversity that depends on them. Specific threats include the collection of tern and sea turtle eggs.</p>", "Criterion1": "Yes", "Criterion2": "Yes", "Criterion3": "Yes", "Criterion4": "No", "Criterion5": "Yes", "Criterion6": "Yes", "Criterion7": "Yes", "Criterion8": "Yes", "Criterion9": "No", "Wetland Type": "Inland wetlands, O: Permanent freshwater lakes, Zk(b): Karst and other subterranean hydrological systems, Tp: Permanent freshwater marshes/ pools, Marine or coastal wetlands, F: Estuarine waters, K: Coastal freshwater lagoons, Human-made wetlands, 4: Seasonally flooded agricultural land, 3: Irrigated land, 2: Ponds", "Maximum elevation": "15", "Minimum elevation": "10", "Montreux listed": "No", "Management plan implemented": "No", "Management plan available": "No", "Ecosystem services": "Provisioning Services, Fresh water, Food for humans, Genetic materials, Wetland non-food products, Regulating Services, Maintenance of hydrological regimes, Erosion protection, Climate regulation, Hazard reduction, Pollution control and detoxification, Cultural Services, Recreation and tourism, Spiritual and inspirational, Scientific and educational, Supporting Services, Soil formation, Biodiversity, Nutrient cycling, Pollination", "Threats": "Human settlements (non agricultural), Tourism and recreation areas, Unspecified development, Water regulation, Dredging, Water abstraction, Salinisation, Agriculture & aquaculture, Annual and perennial non-timber crops, Livestock farming and ranching, Energy production and mining, Renewable energy, Oil and gas drilling, Biological resource use, Logging and wood harvesting, Fishing and harvesting aquatic resources, Gathering terrestrial plants, Hunting and collecting terrestrial animals, Human intrusions & disturbance, Recreational and tourism activities, Unspecified/others, Natural system modifications, Vegetation clearance/ land conversion, Fire and fire suppression, Dams and water management/use, Invasive and other problematic species and genes, Introduced genetic material, Invasive non-native/ alien species, Pollution, Air-borne pollutants, Household sewage, urban waste water, Garbage and solid waste, Excess heat, sound, light, Climate change & severe weather, Droughts, Temperature extremes, Storms and flooding, Habitat shifting and alteration, Transportation and service corridors, Shipping lanes, Geological events, Unspecified", "large administrative region": "ZIGUINCHOR", "Does the wetland extend onto the territory of one or more other countries?": "No", "Ramsar Advisory Mission?": "No" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -16.713594358204301, 12.8099650986386 ] } }
