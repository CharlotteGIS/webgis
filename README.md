# Interactive web maps
The repository contains a website with different sub-pages and several interactive web maps created with different tools and languages to practice visualization and web mapping skills.
Main focus during the creation of the website and maps has been on practicing visualization and web mapping skills rather than on thorough research.


As base template for the general structure of the page, a free template from  HTML5 UP was used and adapted. Maps have been created with the following

- Leaflet and javascript / HTML ( main page)
- Python and the Folium library (Protected areas)
- Google Earth Engine : App development (Population data)

The Live Site is available under the following link https://charlottegis.github.io/webmaps/
